# SocketLogger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/instacart/SocketLogger.swift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/instacart/SocketLogger.swift)

SocketLogger is a logging Âµlib compatible with any socket-based syslog
service. Allows flexibility to choose between various logging providers while
integrating with any logging framework of your choice (e.g.
[SwiftyBeaver](https://github.com/SwiftyBeaver/SwiftyBeaver),
[Willow](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/Willow),
[XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger)).

## Requirements

SocketLogger is compatible with iOS 8+, macOS 10.10 and tvOS 9.
Requires Swift 4.

## Installation

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) 

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Add this to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "instacart/SocketLogger.swift"
```

Then run:

```
$ carthage update
```

## Usage

### Swift

Initialize the logger:
```swift
import SocketLogger
let logger = SocketLogger(host: "myloggingprovider.io", port: 0356, token: "[token]")
```

Log a message (or integrate with a logging framework of your choice):
```swift
logger.log(details: .init(hostname: "mymachine.example.com", application: "SocketLogger"),
           message: "A socket is a generalized interprocess communication channel.")
```

## Integration

We have included a handful of
[examples](https://github.com/instacart/SocketLogger.swift/tree/master/Examples)
for using SocketLogger with popular logging frameworks in this repo.

### Carthage

Since Carthage has no notion of subspecs, these must be copied manually:

- Run `carthage checkout`.
- Drag `Carthage/Checkouts/SocketLogger.swift/Examples/{library}` to your
  project. Make sure the "Copy items if needed" toggle is turned off.
- Integrate according to instructions with your logging framework.

## Providers

SocketLogger currently supports:

- [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/)
- [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/)
- [LogDNA](https://logdna.com/)
